This is the source code for my portfolio site, which you can see in action [over here](https://www.youfounddaniel.com). The objective was to learn React, and in doing so, provide a quick overview of what I've done and what I'm working on right now.

## Running the code

It's built using ReactJS. That means running it locally is also very easy. Just do:

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
- Ensure node is installed
- Clone this repo
- Go into "PortfolioSite" and hit "npm i"
- When that's finished, hit in "npm start"
- The app should now be running on localhost:3000
